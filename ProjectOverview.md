# Introduction #

For the Spring, 2007 semester, the VLSI class plans to develop a MIPS microprocessor. The processor will implement the MIPS [R2000](https://code.google.com/p/hmc-mips/source/detail?r=2000)-class instruction set as well as utilize a cache memory system.


# Project Design Proposal #
